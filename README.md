Extra Tasks
Experience with Unit Test (Jest)

This was my first time writing any test, however going through the documentation about the mentioned testing tool. I managed to do some smoke testing and snapshot testing and also got to learn about event testing. 

Also, I managed to show the error message nicely in the UI.

App for the production mode:  A new branch is created in the git called “production” which has “build files” along with server.js and is ready for the deployment.
